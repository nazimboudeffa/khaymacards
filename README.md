## Installing and running the app

Clone the repository. Inside the newly created directory, run `npm install` to install the Node.js packages listed in `package.json`. Then run `node app.js` to start the server. The server will listen to connections on port `3000`; you can change that behaviour by editing the code. You can access the app by navigating to http://localhost:3000/.
